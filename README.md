# score-predictor
we have created a model which can predict the score of team which is batting first in a ipl match.
for this we have trained and tested a linear regression model using dataset ipl.csv and saved it with extention of pkl.
Now this model will accept some data like runs in 10 overs ,wickets in hand and summary of previous 5 overs
which will predict total runs after 20 overs.The model will also accept name of batting and name of bowling team.
Along with it we also have created a front end side for the project using flask,html and css.
